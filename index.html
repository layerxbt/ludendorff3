This comes after careful consideration of various factors. While we are sad to say goodbye, we are immensely grateful for the trust and support you have shown us throughout the years. Your engagement, feedback, and loyalty are the reason for SRYDEN's huge amounts of growth and success.<br><br>

As of December 1st 2023, all SRYDEN services will be permanently discontinued. We want to express our deepest gratitude to each and every one of you who has been a part of the multiple communities within SRYDEN.<br><br>

All users will automatically receive refunds on January 1st 2024. In preparation for the closure, all virtual machines (VMs) will be taken offline on November 30th 2023. Please ensure that you have retrieved any essential data or information from your VMs before this date.<br><br>

Thank you for being an integral part of our journey. We wish you all the best in your future endeavors.
